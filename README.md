# OSINT on Rohingya Crisis (2016-2019)

This work leverages open-source intelligence and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyse and assess the variation of frames within a dataset comprising social media posts, news reports and government documents surrounding the Rohingya crisis.

## Abstract

This work delves into the utilisation of Open Source Intelligence to analyse the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar using social media posts, geographic coordinates, news reports and government reports in India and Bangladesh. These nations not only observe the conflict but also host Rohingya refugees. Utilising text-as-data methods, the work identifies specific themes and sourcing patterns shared between mainstream and social media. It also employs correlation analysis to explore the alignment of narratives among governments, traditional media outlets, and online communities. This analysis reveals the complex factors that determine whether a country's national interest is mirrored in the online discourse of its citizens, including the nature of that interest and the government's influence over media and social media narratives.
